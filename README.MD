BeeWork
Unleashing the Hive to BEEat the context window

## Inspiration

Agents have limited context window, how do we create extremely high quality and verifiable responses from the web?

## What it does

Create a "knowledge base" on some topic (basically a wiki, and literally a git repo), with hundreds of browser agents (spawned through an orchestrator) created rigorously cited and specific prs into the repo. Then we have review agents that ensures that only prs are merged after meeting strict adversarial standards.  From here a chat agent can navigate the repo to find specific information, and answer questions, with citations to specific docs where more information can be found.

## What's next for BeeWork
