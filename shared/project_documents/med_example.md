# Medical Knowledgebase: Alzheimer's Disease

## Objective

Build a comprehensive knowledge base about Alzheimer's disease for a medical student. The goal is to cover the disease from multiple perspectives: clinical, pathological, therapeutic, and societal. 

## Knowledgebase Structure

Determine the file structure yourself.

## Research Requirements

Make sure to take into account different covariates when looking at different genetic diseases that have to do with alzheimers disesase. 

## Scope

This is a small-scope test run. Keep it focused:

- Create a knowledgebase with at most 10 files.
- Each research task should target a **single file** and a **single source website**
- Keep prompts short and specific -- one clear question per task
