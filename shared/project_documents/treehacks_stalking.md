# Treehacks knowledge base

## Objective

Build an extremely in depth knowledge base on the 2026 Stanford treehacks hackathon. The purpose of this knowledge base is to find as much information as humanely possible about the hackathon. This includes information about the sponsors, the companies that are attending, the projects that are being built, the judges, the mentors, the schedule, the location, the theme, the prizes, and any other relevant information. Scower the web for any and all relevant infromation. Look through linkedin, instagram, twitter, and any other social media platforms to find information about the hackers, judges, mentors, and sponsors. Look through the treehacks website and all of its subpages. Also look at the dev post to see information about the projects that are being built. Some important cites to consider are: https://treehacks-2026.devpost.com, https://treehacks.com, https://live.treehacks.com/, ultimate info guide -> https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSO3GR_kpxlGOpMPODQ-4K4I0OXtgHjm9hzKx6vWIANyBUdSqESIQuGlsYxw3I8LwvPjchPgFrvRRkE/pub, https://www.timbermarket.lol/. The linkedin page can be found at: https://www.linkedin.com/company/treehacks/, where you may found several of the organizers. The slack link can be found at: https://app.slack.com/client/T0AAE9ZCCFL/C0AB8K4P1EC. The slack is a gold mine, so assign many tasks to look through the slack. Specifically, you can find a lot about events, judges, events, organizers, etc.

Make sure to have multiple agents look through the slack, but do not send any messages! 

You willl likely have to create create several tasks that use the same websites, but with very different objectives, given the limited scope. Focus the majority of your tasks on looking through the treehacks website and devpost.

## Knowledgebase Structure

```
knowledgebase/
  sponsors/
  projects/
  organizers/
  mentors/
  presentors/
  event_schedule/
  tracks/
  misc/
  
```

The knowledgebase should have a depth of about 3 (excluding the root knowledgebase folder), though individual folders may have different depths. 

## Research Requirements

For each sponsor, include information about the company, what their prize is, and any other relevant information. 

For each project, include information about the project, the team members, and any other relevant information. 

For the organizers, you should include information from their linkedin if found. 

For each mentor, include information you can find online about them, and any other relevant information from the google doc. You can specific mentor descriptions here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mvUlkrcwIzGXcRnfBc6pH_v3DbkyRFfGLs0K2FVPy5o/edit?tab=t.0 Include in depth profiles about each of them.

For each track, include information about what the project is looking for.

For each event schedule, include information about the event schedule from live.treehacks.com.

For misc, just try to find some weird and interesting information about the hackathon, particularly the people in the slack.



## Scope

- You are looking to demonstrate a surprisingly in depth knowledge base about the 2026 Stanford treehacks hackathon. 
- You should be aggressive in the number of research tasks you create.
- Since there are only going to be a few reliable websites to look through, make sure that each one of them has many different types of research tasks.
