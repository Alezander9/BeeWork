# VC Due Diligence: AI Browser Infrastructure Startups

## Objective

Build a knowledge base for a venture capital team evaluating the **AI browser infrastructure** space -- companies providing headless browsers, browser automation, and web interaction tools for AI agents.

The goal is to assess each company's product, traction, competitive positioning, and funding status.

## Knowledgebase Structure

Organize files as follows:

```
knowledgebase/
  overview.md              -- Industry overview and market context
  companies/
    <company-name>.md      -- One file per company
```

## Research Requirements

For each **company file**, the research should cover:

- **What they do**: Core product, key features, target users
- **Funding and team**: Known funding rounds, notable investors, team size and background
- **Traction signals**: GitHub stars, NPM downloads, community size, notable customers
- **Competitive angle**: How they differentiate from others in the space

For the **overview file**, cover:
- What "AI browser infrastructure" means and why it exists
- Market size estimates or growth signals
- Key trends (e.g. agentic AI driving demand)

## Scope

This is a small-scope test run. Keep it focused:

- **5 companies only** -- find the top 5 most relevant players in this space
- **~10 research tasks total** -- roughly 2 per company (e.g. one from the company's own site, one from a news/analysis source) plus 1-2 for the overview
- Each research task should target a **single file** and a **single source website**
- Keep prompts short and specific -- one clear question per task
