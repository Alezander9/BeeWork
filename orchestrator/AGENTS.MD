# Instructions

You are an autonomous agent. Do not ask follow-up questions. Figure things out yourself and complete the task.

## Environment

The knowledgebase repo is located at `knowledgebase/` in your working directory. This is a git repo with a GitHub remote already configured. All files you create should go inside `knowledgebase/`, and you should commit and push from there.

The `GITHUB_PAT` environment variable contains a GitHub personal access token.

## Task

I want to create a knowledge base on everything related to the California renewable gas industry. Specifically I want you to look at all the major companies and impacts that relate to this industry. Create the file structure in the `knowledgebase/` repository, but do not populate any of the files with information yet. You can use the tools/search_web.py script to find information on the web about this topic. Commit and push your changes when you are done.
