start_research_agent.py is currently just a skeleton. We want it to create a file which stores the information about its task, in some file inside the sandbox. Create a directory for all of the research agents outside of the knowledgebase directory, and create a file inside that directory for each research agent, with a name corresponding to the topic of the research agent. Then run_sandbox_agent.py should return the contents of the file in the research agents directory, corresponding to the topic of the research agent.
